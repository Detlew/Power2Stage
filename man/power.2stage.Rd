\title{
Power calculation of adaptive 2-stage BE studies with 2x2 crossover design
}
\description{
This function calculates the empirical power of 2-stage BE studies according
to Potvin et al. via simulations. The Potvin methods are modified to include
a futility criterion Nmax and to allow the sample size estimation step to be 
done with point estimate & mse of stage 1.
}
\usage{
power.2stage(method = c("B", "C", "B0"), alpha0 = 0.05, alpha = c(0.0294, 0.0294), 
             n1, GMR, CV, targetpower = 0.8, pmethod = c("nct", "exact", "shifted"),
             usePE = FALSE, Nmax = Inf, min.n2=0, theta0, theta1, theta2,  
             npct = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), nsims, setseed = TRUE, details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{method}{
Decision schemes according to Potvin et.al. Default is "B". \cr
Potvin method D can be obtained by choosing "C" but setting 
\code{alpha=c(0.028,0.028)}\cr.
\code{method="B0"} uses the decision scheme of so-called "MSDBE" which differs
from B/E in case of different alpha's w.r.t. power monitoring and BE decision
in case of power >= target power.
}
  \item{alpha0}{
Alpha value for the first step(s) in Potvin "C"", the power inspection
and BE decision if power > targetpower.\cr
Defaults to 0.05.
}
  \item{alpha}{
Vector of the nominal alpha's for the two stages.\cr
Defaults to the Pocock alpha setting \code{alpha=c(0.0294,0.0294)}.
}
  \item{n1}{
Sample size for stage 1.
}
  \item{GMR}{
Ratio T/R to be used in the Potvin decision schemes (power calculations 
in stage 1 and sample size estimation for stage 2).
}
  \item{CV}{
Coefficient of variation of the intra-subject variability as ratio.
}
  \item{targetpower}{
Power threshold in the power monitoring steps and 
power to achieve in the sample size estimation step.
}
  \item{pmethod}{
Power calculation method, also to be used in the sample size estimation for 
stage 2.\cr 
Implemented are \code{"nct"} = approximate calculations via non-central 
t-distribution and \code{"exact"} = exact calculations via Owen's Q as well as
the approximation via shifted central t-distribution, as used by Potvin et al.\cr
Defaults to "nct" as reasonable compromise between speed and accuracy in the 
sample size estimation step.
}
  \item{usePE}{
If \code{TRUE} the sample size estimation step is done with PE and mse of 
stage 1.\cr
Defaults to \code{FALSE} in wich case the sample size is estimated with GMR and 
mse of stage 1 analogous to Potvin et. al.\cr
The power inspection steps in the Potvin methods are always done with the
GMR argument and mse (CV) of stage 1.
}
  \item{Nmax}{
Futility criterion. If set to a finite value all studies simulated in which a 
sample size >Nmax is obtained will be regarded as BE=FAIL.\cr
Set this argument to \code{Inf}, the default, to work without that futility
criterion.
}
  \item{min.n2}{
Minimum sample size of stage 2. Defaults to zero.\cr
If the sample size estimation step gives N <= n1 the sample size for stage 2 
will be set to \code{min.n2}, i.e. the total sample size to \code{n1+min.n2}.
}
  \item{theta0}{
True ratio of T/R for simulating. Defaults to the \code{GMR} argument if missing.
}
  \item{theta1}{
Lower bioequivalence limit. Defaults to 0.8.
}
  \item{theta2}{
Upper bioequivalence limit. Defaults to 1.25.
}
  \item{npct}{
Percentiles to be used for the presentation of the distribution of n(total)=n1+n2.\cr
Defaults to \code{c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95)} to obtain the 5\% and 95\% percentiles
and the median.
}
  \item{nsims}{
Number of studies to simulate.\cr 
If missing is set to 1E+05 = 100 000 or to 1E+06 = 1 mio if you are calculating 
'alpha', i.e. with \code{theta0} at border or outside acceptance range 
\code{theta1} ... \code{theta2}.
}
  \item{setseed}{
Simulations are dependent on the starting point of the (pseudo) random number 
generator. To avoid differences in power for different runs a \code{set.seed(1234567)} 
is issued if \code{setseed=TRUE}, the default.\cr
Set this argument to \code{FALSE} to view the variation in power between 
different runs.
}
  \item{details}{
If set to \code{TRUE} the function prints the results of time measurements
of the simulation steps. Default is \code{FALSE}.
}
}
\details{
The calculations follow in principle the simulations as described in 
Potvin et al.\cr
The underlying subject data are assumed to be evaluated after log-transformation.
But instead of simulating subject data the statistics pe1, mse1 and pe2, SS2 are
simulated via their associated distributions (normal and chi-squared 
distri's).
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "pwrtsd" with all the input arguments and results 
as components.\cr
The class "pwrtsd" has an S3 print method.\cr
The results are in the components:
\item{pBE}{Contains the ratio of studies found BE.}
\item{pBE_s1}{Ratio of studies found BE in stage 1.}
\item{pct_s2}{Percentage of studies continuing to stage 2.}
\item{nmean}{Mean of n(total).}
\item{nrange}{Range (min, max) of n(total).}
\item{nperc}{Vector of percentiles of the distribution of n(total).}
\item{ntable}{Object of class "table" summarizing the discrete distribution of 
n(total) via its distinct values and counts of occurences of these values.\cr
This component is only given back if \code{usePE==FALSE} or otherwise if 
\code{is.finite(Nmax)}, i.e. a futility criterion is used.}
